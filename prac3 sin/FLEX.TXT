NAME
     flex - fast lexical analyzer generator

SYNOPSIS
     flex [-bcdfinpstvFILT8 -C[efmF] -Sskeleton] [_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e ...]

DESCRIPTION
     _f_l_e_x is a  tool  for  generating  _s_c_a_n_n_e_r_s:  programs  which
     recognized  lexical  patterns in text.  _f_l_e_x reads the given
     input files, or its standard input  if  no  file  names  are
     given,  for  a  description  of  a scanner to generate.  The
     description is in the form of pairs of  regular  expressions
     and  C  code,  called  _r_u_l_e_s.  _f_l_e_x  generates as output a C
     source file, lexyy.c, which defines a routine yylex(). This
     file is compiled and linked with the -lfl library to produce
     an executable.  When the executable is run, it analyzes  its
     input  for occurrences of the regular expressions.  Whenever
     it finds one, it executes the corresponding C code.

     For full documentation, see flexdoc(1). This manual entry is
     intended for use as a quick reference.

OPTIONS
     _f_l_e_x has the following options:

     -b   Generate  backtracking  information  to  _l_e_x._b_a_c_k_t_r_a_c_k.
          This  is  a  list of scanner states which require back-
          tracking and the input characters on which they do  so.
          By adding rules one can remove backtracking states.  If
          all backtracking states are eliminated and -f or -F  is
          used, the generated scanner will run faster.

     -c   is a do-nothing, deprecated option included  for  POSIX
          compliance.

          NOTE: in previous releases of _f_l_e_x -c specified  table-
          compression  options.   This functionality is now given
          by the -C flag.  To ease the the impact of this change,
          when  _f_l_e_x encounters -c, it currently issues a warning
          message and assumes that -C was  desired  instead.   In
          the future this "promotion" of -c to -C will go away in
          the name of full POSIX  compliance  (unless  the  POSIX
          meaning is removed first).

     -d   makes the generated scanner run in _d_e_b_u_g  mode.   When-
          ever   a   pattern   is   recognized   and  the  global
          yy_flex_debug is non-zero (which is the  default),  the
          scanner will write to _s_t_d_e_r_r a line of the form:

              --accepting rule at line 53 ("the matched text")

          The line number refers to the location of the  rule  in

          the  file defining the scanner (i.e., the file that was
          fed to flex).  Messages are  also  generated  when  the
          scanner  backtracks,  accepts the default rule, reaches
          the end of its input buffer (or encounters a  NUL;  the
          two  look  the same as far as the scanner's concerned),
          or reaches an end-of-file.

     -f   specifies (take your pick) _f_u_l_l _t_a_b_l_e or _f_a_s_t  _s_c_a_n_n_e_r.
          No  table compression is done.  The result is large but
          fast.  This option is equivalent to -Cf (see below).

     -i   instructs _f_l_e_x to generate a _c_a_s_e-_i_n_s_e_n_s_i_t_i_v_e  scanner.
          The  case  of  letters given in the _f_l_e_x input patterns
          will be ignored,  and  tokens  in  the  input  will  be
          matched  regardless of case.  The matched text given in
          _y_y_t_e_x_t will have the preserved case (i.e., it will  not
          be folded).

     -n   is another do-nothing, deprecated option included  only
          for POSIX compliance.

     -p   generates a performance report to stderr.   The  report
          consists  of  comments  regarding  features of the _f_l_e_x
          input file which will cause a loss  of  performance  in
          the resulting scanner.

     -s   causes the _d_e_f_a_u_l_t _r_u_l_e (that unmatched  scanner  input
          is  echoed to _s_t_d_o_u_t) to be suppressed.  If the scanner
          encounters input that does not match any of its  rules,
          it aborts with an error.

     -t   instructs _f_l_e_x to write the  scanner  it  generates  to
          standard output instead of lex.yy.c.

     -v   specifies that _f_l_e_x should write to _s_t_d_e_r_r a summary of
          statistics regarding the scanner it generates.

     -F   specifies that the _f_a_s_t  scanner  table  representation
          should  be  used.  This representation is about as fast
          as the full table representation  (-_f),  and  for  some
          sets  of patterns will be considerably smaller (and for
          others, larger).  See flexdoc(1) for details.

          This option is equivalent to -CF (see below).

     -I   instructs _f_l_e_x to generate an _i_n_t_e_r_a_c_t_i_v_e scanner, that
          is, a scanner which stops immediately rather than look-
          ing ahead if it knows that the currently  scanned  text
          cannot  be  part  of a longer rule's match.  Again, see
          flexdoc(1) for details.

          Note, -I cannot be used in  conjunction  with  _f_u_l_l  or

          _f_a_s_t _t_a_b_l_e_s, i.e., the -f, -F, -Cf, or -CF flags.

     -L   instructs _f_l_e_x not  to  generate  #line  directives  in
          lex.yy.c. The default is to generate such directives so
          error messages in the actions will be correctly located
          with  respect  to the original _f_l_e_x input file, and not
          to the fairly meaningless line numbers of lex.yy.c.

     -T   makes _f_l_e_x run in _t_r_a_c_e mode.  It will generate  a  lot
          of  messages to _s_t_d_o_u_t concerning the form of the input
          and the resultant non-deterministic  and  deterministic
          finite  automata.   This  option  is  mostly for use in
          maintaining _f_l_e_x.

     -8   instructs _f_l_e_x to generate an 8-bit scanner.   On  some
          sites,  this is the default.  On others, the default is
          7-bit characters.  To see which is the case, check  the
          verbose  (-v) output for "equivalence classes created".
          If the denominator of the number shown is 128, then  by
          default  _f_l_e_x is generating 7-bit characters.  If it is
          256, then the default is 8-bit characters.

     -C[efmF]
          controls the degree of table compression.

          -Ce directs  _f_l_e_x  to  construct  _e_q_u_i_v_a_l_e_n_c_e  _c_l_a_s_s_e_s,
          i.e.,  sets  of characters which have identical lexical
          properties.  Equivalence classes usually give  dramatic
          reductions  in the final table/object file sizes (typi-
          cally  a  factor  of  2-5)   and   are   pretty   cheap
          performance-wise   (one  array  look-up  per  character
          scanned).

          -Cf specifies that the _f_u_l_l scanner  tables  should  be
          generated - _f_l_e_x should not compress the tables by tak-
          ing advantages of similar transition functions for dif-
          ferent states.

          -CF specifies that the alternate fast scanner represen-
          tation (described in flexdoc(1)) should be used.

          -Cm directs _f_l_e_x to construct _m_e_t_a-_e_q_u_i_v_a_l_e_n_c_e _c_l_a_s_s_e_s,
          which  are  sets of equivalence classes (or characters,
          if equivalence classes are not  being  used)  that  are
          commonly  used  together.  Meta-equivalence classes are
          often a big win when using compressed tables, but  they
          have  a  moderate  performance  impact (one or two "if"
          tests and one array look-up per character scanned).

          A lone -C specifies that the scanner tables  should  be
          compressed  but  neither  equivalence classes nor meta-
          equivalence classes should be used.

          The options -Cf or  -CF  and  -Cm  do  not  make  sense
          together - there is no opportunity for meta-equivalence
          classes if the table is not being  compressed.   Other-
          wise the options may be freely mixed.

          The default setting is -Cem, which specifies that  _f_l_e_x
          should   generate   equivalence   classes   and   meta-
          equivalence classes.  This setting provides the highest
          degree   of  table  compression.   You  can  trade  off
          faster-executing scanners at the cost of larger  tables
          with the following generally being true:

              slowest & smallest
                    -Cem
                    -Cm
                    -Ce
                    -C
                    -C{f,F}e
                    -C{f,F}
              fastest & largest


          -C options are not cumulative;  whenever  the  flag  is
          encountered, the previous -C settings are forgotten.

     -Sskeleton_file
          overrides the default skeleton  file  from  which  _f_l_e_x
          constructs its scanners.  You'll never need this option
          unless you are doing _f_l_e_x maintenance or development.

SUMMARY OF FLEX REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
     The patterns in the input are written using an extended  set
     of regular expressions.  These are:

         x          match the character 'x'
         .          any character except newline
         [xyz]      a "character class"; in this case, the pattern
                      matches either an 'x', a 'y', or a 'z'
         [abj-oZ]   a "character class" with a range in it; matches
                      an 'a', a 'b', any letter from 'j' through 'o',
                      or a 'Z'
         [^A-Z]     a "negated character class", i.e., any character
                      but those in the class.  In this case, any
                      character EXCEPT an uppercase letter.
         [^A-Z\n]   any character EXCEPT an uppercase letter or
                      a newline
         r*         zero or more r's, where r is any regular expression
         r+         one or more r's
         r?         zero or one r's (that is, "an optional r")
         r{2,5}     anywhere from two to five r's
         r{2,}      two or more r's
         r{4}       exactly 4 r's

         {name}     the expansion of the "name" definition
                    (see above)
         "[xyz]\"foo"
                    the literal string: [xyz]"foo
         \X         if X is an 'a', 'b', 'f', 'n', 'r', 't', or 'v',
                      then the ANSI-C interpretation of \x.
                      Otherwise, a literal 'X' (used to escape
                      operators such as '*')
         \123       the character with octal value 123
         \x2a       the character with hexadecimal value 2a
         (r)        match an r; parentheses are used to override
                      precedence (see below)


         rs         the regular expression r followed by the
                      regular expression s; called "concatenation"


         r|s        either an r or an s


         r/s        an r but only if it is followed by an s.  The
                      s is not part of the matched text.  This type
                      of pattern is called as "trailing context".
         ^r         an r, but only at the beginning of a line
         r$         an r, but only at the end of a line.  Equivalent
                      to "r/\n".


         <s>r       an r, but only in start condition s (see
                    below for discussion of start conditions)
         <s1,s2,s3>r
                    same, but in any of start conditions s1,
                    s2, or s3


         <<EOF>>    an end-of-file
         <s1,s2><<EOF>>
                    an end-of-file when in start condition s1 or s2

     The regular expressions listed above are  grouped  according
     to  precedence, from highest precedence at the top to lowest
     at the bottom.   Those  grouped  together  have  equal  pre-
     cedence.

     Some notes on patterns:

     -    Negated character classes _m_a_t_c_h  _n_e_w_l_i_n_e_s  unless  "\n"
          (or  an equivalent escape sequence) is one of the char-
          acters explicitly  present  in  the  negated  character
          class (e.g., "[^A-Z\n]").

     -    A rule can have at most one instance of  trailing  con-
          text (the '/' operator or the '$' operator).  The start
          condition, '^', and "<<EOF>>" patterns can  only  occur
          at the beginning of a pattern, and, as well as with '/'
          and '$', cannot be  grouped  inside  parentheses.   The
          following are all illegal:

              foo/bar$
              foo|(bar$)
              foo|^bar
              <sc1>foo<sc2>bar


SUMMARY OF SPECIAL ACTIONS
     In addition to arbitrary C code, the following can appear in
     actions:

     -    ECHO copies yytext to the scanner's output.

     -    BEGIN followed by the name of a start condition  places
          the scanner in the corresponding start condition.

     -    REJECT directs the scanner to proceed on to the "second
          best"  rule which matched the input (or a prefix of the
          input).  yytext and yyleng are  set  up  appropriately.
          Note that REJECT is a particularly expensive feature in
          terms scanner performance; if it is used in _a_n_y of  the
          scanner's   actions  it  will  slow  down  _a_l_l  of  the
          scanner's matching.  Furthermore, REJECT cannot be used
          with the -_f or -_F options.

          Note also that unlike the other special actions, REJECT
          is  a  _b_r_a_n_c_h;  code  immediately  following  it in the
          action will _n_o_t be executed.

     -    yymore() tells  the  scanner  that  the  next  time  it
          matches  a  rule,  the  corresponding  token  should be
          _a_p_p_e_n_d_e_d onto the current value of yytext  rather  than
          replacing it.

     -    yyless(n) returns all but the first _n characters of the
          current token back to the input stream, where they will
          be rescanned when the scanner looks for the next match.
          yytext  and  yyleng  are  adjusted appropriately (e.g.,
          yyleng will now be equal to _n ).

     -    unput(c) puts the  character  _c  back  onto  the  input
          stream.  It will be the next character scanned.

     -    input() reads the next character from the input  stream
          (this  routine  is  called  yyinput() if the scanner is
          compiled using C++).

     -    yyterminate() can be used in lieu of a return statement
          in  an action.  It terminates the scanner and returns a
          0 to the scanner's caller, indicating "all done".

          By default, yyterminate() is also called when  an  end-
          of-file is encountered.  It is a macro and may be rede-
          fined.

     -    YY_NEW_FILE is an  action  available  only  in  <<EOF>>
          rules.   It  means "Okay, I've set up a new input file,
          continue scanning".

     -    yy_create_buffer( file, size ) takes a _F_I_L_E pointer and
          an integer _s_i_z_e. It returns a YY_BUFFER_STATE handle to
          a new input buffer  large  enough  to  accomodate  _s_i_z_e
          characters and associated with the given file.  When in
          doubt, use YY_BUF_SIZE for the size.

     -    yy_switch_to_buffer(   new_buffer   )   switches    the
          scanner's  processing to scan for tokens from the given
          buffer, which must be a YY_BUFFER_STATE.

     -    yy_delete_buffer( buffer ) deletes the given buffer.

VALUES AVAILABLE TO THE USER
     -    char *yytext holds the text of the current  token.   It
          may not be modified.

     -    int yyleng holds the length of the current  token.   It
          may not be modified.

     -    FILE *yyin is the file  which  by  default  _f_l_e_x  reads
          from.   It  may  be  redefined  but doing so only makes
          sense before scanning begins.  Changing it in the  mid-
          dle of scanning will have unexpected results since _f_l_e_x
          buffers its input.  Once scanning terminates because an
          end-of-file   has   been  seen,  void  yyrestart(  FILE
          *new_file ) may be called to  point  _y_y_i_n  at  the  new
          input file.

     -    FILE *yyout is the file to which ECHO actions are done.
          It can be reassigned by the user.

     -    YY_CURRENT_BUFFER returns a YY_BUFFER_STATE  handle  to
          the current buffer.

MACROS THE USER CAN REDEFINE
     -    YY_DECL controls how the scanning routine is  declared.
          By  default, it is "int yylex()", or, if prototypes are
          being used, "int yylex(void)".  This definition may  be
          changed  by  redefining the "YY_DECL" macro.  Note that
          if you give arguments to the scanning routine  using  a

          K&R-style/non-prototyped function declaration, you must
          terminate the definition with a semi-colon (;).

     -    The nature of how the scanner gets  its  input  can  be
          controlled    by   redefining   the   YY_INPUT   macro.
          YY_INPUT's         calling         sequence          is
          "YY_INPUT(buf,result,max_size)".    Its  action  is  to
          place up to _m_a_x__s_i_z_e characters in the character  array
          _b_u_f  and  return  in the integer variable _r_e_s_u_l_t either
          the number of characters read or the  constant  YY_NULL
          (0  on  Unix  systems)  to  indicate  EOF.  The default
          YY_INPUT reads from the global file-pointer "yyin".   A
          sample  redefinition  of  YY_INPUT  (in the definitions
          section of the input file):

              %{
              #undef YY_INPUT
              #define YY_INPUT(buf,result,max_size) \
                  { \
                  int c = getchar(); \
                  result = (c == EOF) ? YY_NULL : (buf[0] = c, 1); \
                  }
              %}


     -    When the scanner  receives  an  end-of-file  indication
          from  YY_INPUT,  it  then checks the yywrap() function.
          If yywrap() returns false (zero), then  it  is  assumed
          that  the  function  has  gone ahead and set up _y_y_i_n to
          point to another input file,  and  scanning  continues.
          If  it  returns  true (non-zero), then the scanner ter-
          minates, returning 0 to its caller.

          The default yywrap() always returns 1.   Presently,  to
          redefine  it  you  must first "#undef yywrap", as it is
          currently implemented as a macro.  It  is  likely  that
          yywrap()  will  soon be defined to be a function rather
          than a macro.

     -    YY_USER_ACTION can be redefined to  provide  an  action
          which  is  always  executed prior to the matched rule's
          action.

     -    The macro YY_USER_INIT may be redefined to  provide  an
          action which is always executed before the first scan.

     -    In the generated scanner, the actions are all  gathered
          in  one  large  switch  statement  and  separated using
          YY_BREAK, which may be redefined.  By  default,  it  is
          simply  a  "break", to separate each rule's action from
          the following rule's.

DEFICIENCIES / BUGS
     Some trailing context patterns cannot  be  properly  matched
     and  generate  warning  messages  ("Dangerous  trailing con-
     text").  These are patterns where the ending  of  the  first
     part  of  the rule matches the beginning of the second part,
     such as "zx*/xy*", where the 'x*' matches  the  'x'  at  the
     beginning  of  the  trailing  context.  (Note that the POSIX
     draft states that the text matched by such patterns is unde-
     fined.)

     For some trailing context rules, parts  which  are  actually
     fixed-length  are  not  recognized  as  such, leading to the
     abovementioned performance loss.  In particular, parts using
     '|'   or  {n}  (such  as  "foo{3}")  are  always  considered
     variable-length.

     Combining trailing context with the special '|'  action  can
     result  in _f_i_x_e_d trailing context being turned into the more
     expensive _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e trailing context.  For example, this hap-
     pens in the following example:

         %%
         abc      |
         xyz/def


     Use of unput() invalidates yytext and yyleng.

     Use of unput() to push back more text than was  matched  can
     result  in the pushed-back text matching a beginning-of-line
     ('^') rule even though it didn't come at  the  beginning  of
     the line (though this is rare!).

     Pattern-matching  of  NUL's  is  substantially  slower  than
     matching other characters.

     _f_l_e_x does not generate correct  #line  directives  for  code
     internal to the scanner; thus, bugs in _f_l_e_x._s_k_e_l yield bogus

     line numbers.

     Due to both buffering of input and  read-ahead,  you  cannot
     intermix  calls to <stdio.h> routines, such as, for example,
     getchar(), with _f_l_e_x rules and  expect  it  to  work.   Call
     input() instead.

     The total table entries listed by the -v flag  excludes  the
     number  of  table  entries needed to determine what rule has
     been matched.  The number of entries is equal to the  number
     of  DFA states if the scanner does not use REJECT, and some-
     what greater than the number of states if it does.

     REJECT cannot be used with the -_f or -_F options.

     Some of the macros, such as  yywrap(),  may  in  the  future
     become  functions which live in the -lfl library.  This will
     doubtless break a lot of  code,  but  may  be  required  for
     POSIX-compliance.

     The _f_l_e_x internal algorithms need documentation.
